🚍 TechStrat 2026 – TransLink BEB Strategy

Preliminary Case Submission

This project was developed for the TechStrat 2026 Preliminary Case Release (TransLink), focused on scaling Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) while maintaining operational reliability and infrastructure efficiency.

📌 Problem

As TransLink expands its zero-emission fleet, key risks include:

Charging congestion at depots

Battery range uncertainty

Missed pull-outs due to insufficient charge

High infrastructure capital costs

Electrification must improve sustainability without compromising service reliability.

💡 Core Recommendation

We propose a Smart Charging & Operations Optimization Framework:

Priority-Based Charging
Allocate charging slots based on pull-out time, route distance, and state-of-charge.

Charge-Aware Bus Assignment
Integrate charging constraints into bus-to-block scheduling logic.

Predictive Risk Alerts
Flag potential charging conflicts or delay risks before morning dispatch.

📊 Expected Impact

Improved fleet reliability

Reduced depot congestion

Higher charging efficiency

Better infrastructure ROI

Scalable electrification strategy

🛠 Analytical Approach

Capacity modeling

Operational simulation

Priority queue logic
